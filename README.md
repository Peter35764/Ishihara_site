Pretrained models and data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ozmXSO1rwNnQABr3Upd2CmUa8xJh6Ia?usp=drive_link)

Training of neural networks can be found [here](https://github.com/V13kv/SamsungAI)

## Usage
1. Create .venv:
```python -m venv .venv```
2. Activate:
```source venv/bin/activate```
3. Install requirements:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
4. Add files from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ozmXSO1rwNnQABr3Upd2CmUa8xJh6Ia?usp=drive_link) into models/trained/recolor/ with their folders.
5. Run app:
```python main.py```
